# QtDesigner-signals-slots-example
A minimalistic example to illustrate how to configure the signals and slots of custom widgets using Qt Designer with the Qt Python bindings and how (not) to import the UI file.

__Long story short:__ importing the UI file directly fails to properly connect the signal and slot while converting the UI file into a Python class works properly (see [the documentation](https://doc.qt.io/qtforpython/tutorials/basictutorial/uifiles.html)). It seems that the [`QUiLoader`](https://doc.qt.io/archives/qtforpython-5.12/PySide2/QtUiTools/QUiLoader.html) may be failing.

The repository contains:
- `custom_label.py` and `custom_button.py`, two custom widgets subclassing QLabel and QPushButton. The custom button emits a signal containing a Python `list`. The custom label has a custom slot taking a Python `list` as argument.
- `UI_file.ui` and `UI_file.py`, a UI file containing the custom widgets above (promoted from their base class) generated by Qt Designer and the Python class resulting from the conversion using `pyside2-uic UI_file.ui > UI_file.py`. The signal / slot connection is handled in the `UI_file.ui`through Qt designer.
- Two test applications using two different ways to use the UI file (again,see [the documentation](https://doc.qt.io/qtforpython/tutorials/basictutorial/uifiles.html)) : `test_app_with_direct_UI_import.py` and `test_app_with_UI_conversion.py`
- A minimalistic Pipfile.

One may reproduce this example with whatever Python type by changing the value in the custom signal and slot signatures and in Qt Designer.
